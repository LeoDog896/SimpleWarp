SimpleWarp-1.6.4
================

Warp plugin for Minecraft

This is unfinished and seeing as bukkit is kill, possibly won't be finished. Q.Q

Working features:
Setting a warp.
Deleting a warp.
Going to a warp.
Teleporting other players to a warp.
Listing all the warps.
Setting a compass to point at a warp.

Stuff still to be added:
Setting a warp with random co-ordinates (because why not?)
A marker command.
Some permissions.
Manually adding a warp.


Concepts: 
Saving all warps in one file. 
Loading all warps into a list or an array for faster access.
